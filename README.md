## Install

```shell
npm install --save react-native-tts
react-native link
```

## Usage

### Imports

```js
import Tts from 'react-native-tts';
```

### Speaking

Add utterance to TTS queue and start speaking. Returns promise with utteranceId.

```js
Tts.speak('Hello, world!');
```
Stop speaking and flush the TTS queue.

```js
Tts.stop();
```

### Ducking

Enable lowering other applications output level while speaking (also referred to as "ducking").

```js
Tts.setDucking(true);
```

### List Voices

Returns list of available voices 

*(not supported on Android API Level < 21, returns empty list)*

```js
Tts.voices().then(voices => console.log(voices));

// Prints:
//
// [ { id: 'com.apple.ttsbundle.Moira-compact', name: 'Moira', language: 'en-IE' },
// ...
// { id: 'com.apple.ttsbundle.Samantha-compact', name: 'Samantha', language: 'en-US' } ]
```

### Set default Language

```js
Tts.setDefaultLanguage('en-IE');
```

### Set default Voice

Sets default voice, pass one of the voiceId as reported by a call to Tts.voices() 

*(not available on Android API Level < 21)*

```js
Tts.setDefaultVoice('com.apple.ttsbundle.Moira-compact');
```

### Set default Speech Rate

Sets default speech rate. The rate parameter is a float where where 0.01 is a slowest rate and 0.99 is the fastest rate.

```js
Tts.setDefaultRate(0.6);
```

There is a significant difference to how the rate value is interpreted by iOS and Android native TTS APIs. To provide unified cross-platform behaviour, translation is applied to the rate value. However, if you want to turn off the translation, you can provide optional `skipTransform` parameter to `Tts.setDefaultRate()` to pass rate value unmodified.

Do not translate rate parameter:

```js
Tts.setDefaultRate(0.6, true);
```

### Set default Pitch

Sets default pitch. The pitch parameter is a float where where 1.0 is a normal pitch. On iOS min pitch is 0.5 and max pitch is 2.0

```js
Tts.setDefaultPitch(1.5);
```

### Events

Subscribe to TTS events

```js
Tts.addEventListener('tts-start', (event) => console.log("start", event));
Tts.addEventListener('tts-finish', (event) => console.log("finish", event));
Tts.addEventListener('tts-cancel', (event) => console.log("cancel", event));
```
